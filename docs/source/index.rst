Welcome to Overlay Router documentation!
========================================

**Overlay Router** is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. A Overlay router is connected to three or more data lines from different IP networks. When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the network address information in the packet header to determine the ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey.

The Overlay Router allows the computers with same IP address to connect to the control PC this is achieved through using NameSpaces and Virtual ethernet adapters that patches one namespace to other.
